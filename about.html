            <p>Gray Ridge Brewing started back in 1934 before craft beer was “cool”. We are still a family owned and run brewery! Our little family farm was always an egg and chicken farm until1930 when it burned down. In 1933, Prohibition ended in Canada and The Gray family saw this as a perfect opportunity to rebuild their family chicken farm… as a brewery! We took our family’s name, “Gray” and wanted to make it local, taking “Ridge” from our hometown of Ridgetown.
              <br><br>
            We started selling our bottled beer out of our farm house. Word quickly spread and we became a quick hit in Ridgetown. in 2000, we expanded our brewery and opened up distribution throughout Southern Ontario. We remain successful to this day and attribute it all to our secret original family recipe (and beer lovers like you, of course)!
              <br><br>
            Our brew masters have been raised on the brewery-farm their whole lives and live and breathe to bring you the best beers season after season, year after year. The Gray family still raises many chickens on our farm and that is what makes Gray Ridge Brewing’s beers so good… our (not-so) secret ingredient- eggs! Check in often to see what our brew masters have in store next!
              <br><br>
            We are proud to be leaders in the industry when it comes to sustainability and eco-friendly practices. We bring all returned bottles back to our facilities in Ridgetown, Ontario where they go through a rigorous cleaning and sanitization treatment. All of our chickens are free-run and are fed with organic grains and treated with love!
              <br><br>
            You can find us on tap and in cans at many bars and pubs across Ontario. You can find a selection of our canned and bottled beers at your local Beer Store, Beer Store Retail Partner, or LCBO! You can also purchase cans, bottles, and growlers at our Ridgetown brewery.
              <br><br>
            Drop in weekdays between 12 and 6pm, and weekends between 11 and 9pm for a guided brewery tour and tasting every hour on the hour! Or relax with a cold beer poured in our farmhouse taproom expertly paired with one of our chef’s many egg dishes. Dogs welcome!</p>

                <h3>Our Eco Friendly Packaging</h3>
                  <p>All of our cardboard packaging is made from 100% recycled materials and can, of course, be recycled!</p>
                <h3>Recycling & Zero Waste at Gray Ridge</h3>
                  <p>We take back all of our empty bottles to our Ridgetown headquarters where they are rigorously cleaned and sanitized, then refilled with our delicious beer. And repeat. <br><br>New SOPs (standard operating procedures) has reduced total waste generated by 17% and diverted 75% more waste from landfill year over year.</p>
                <h3>Reducing Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions</h3>
                    <p>Upgrading to high efficiency equipment, reducing wash water temperature, and refurbishing our cooler storage with better insulation, led to a 10% decrease in energy consumption in just one year. <br><br> By transitioning most of our trucking fleet to Vector diesel-electric hybrids, we achieved a 30% reduction in fuel usage and emissions compared to standard diesel engines.</p>
